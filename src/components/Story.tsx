            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              A lot of folks think I was always this guy who mastered digital products...but the truth is:
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              I started off totally clueless about digital entrepreneurship. I was trapped in a soul-sucking corporate job for years. It wasn't until I decided to write my first book that I got thrust into the world of online business.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              I was forced to get good at it fast because I left my corporate job the day after my book was published.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Ever hear about Cortez burning the ships so his men couldn't retreat? Yeah...same principle!

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">But it WORKED:</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              I dedicated myself to helping other entrepreneurs, started one of the most successful platforms for digital product creation in the world.
              And it was just a few years ago...
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">After Years In The Business...I Spotted A Pattern</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Something virtually EVERY successful digital entrepreneur was doing...
              And something I'm sure they wanted to keep to themselves.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Their strategy was really centered around one foundational product. Just repackaged and refined a bit.
              Only one. That's all they needed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-orange-500 mb-8">
              And that's all YOU need to make a sweet living from your knowledge.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              It was wild! The sales just started coming in...slow and steady at first.
              Then the pace really picked up.
              And I doubled my business in just under 7 months.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              I decided I had to let other entrepreneurs in on this...so:

              This one book does the hard work for you.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Even as I say this, you might be thinking, "Is this really for me?"
              And that's a valid thought.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Honestly, I can't say for sure without knowing how serious you are about getting paid for your efforts.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
